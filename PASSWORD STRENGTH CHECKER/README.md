# 💪 **Password Strength Checker** 💪


This is a  password strength checker application developed as part of my internship at **Brainwave Matrix Solutions**. It provides users with real-time feedback on the strength of their passwords, helping them choose more secure options.

## ✨ **Features** ✨

* **⚡ Real-time Feedback:** As the user types their password, the application instantly assesses its strength.
* **📊 Visual Indicator:** A color-coded progress bar visually represents the password strength:
    * **🟢 Strong password** (as seen in the output below)

        ![Strong Password Output])
        ```text
        Password Strength: Strong
        Password looks great!
        ```
    * **🟡 Moderate password** (as seen in the output below)

        ```text
        Password Strength: Moderate
        Suggestions:
        Add numbers.
        Add special characters (!@#$% etc).
        ```
    * **🔴 Weak password** (as seen in the output below)

        ```text
        Password Strength: Weak
        Suggestions:
        Avoid common passwords like 'password'.
        ```
* **🔒 Common Password Check:** The application includes a check against a list of common passwords,** including those found in lists from previous data breaches**. This significantly enhances security assessment by identifying passwords that are highly vulnerable to hacking.
* **💡 Suggestions:** When a weak or moderate password is detected, the application provides helpful suggestions to improve its strength.

## 🙏 **Acknowledgements** 🙏

* This application uses the **Tkinter** library for creating the graphical user interface.
* The **`re` (regular expression)** library is used for pattern matching to check for character variety (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters) in the password.
* The list of common passwords (`common_passwords.txt`) is compiled from various sources, including:
    * Lists of passwords from well-known data breaches (e.g., RockYou)
    * Common password lists published by security research organizations.
    * Frequently used password patterns.
    It is intended to help users avoid using credentials that are highly susceptible to cracking.
