🛡️ Phishing Link Scanner
A lightweight and modular Python script designed to detect phishing URLs using heuristic analysis and optional VirusTotal integration.

🚀 Developed as part of an internship at Brainwave Matrix

📌 Overview
This project implements a basic phishing link scanner that checks URLs for red flags commonly associated with phishing attacks. It combines keyword-based inspection, domain checks, and URL structure analysis. Additionally, it supports integration with the VirusTotal API to perform more robust scanning.

🔍 Features
✅ Heuristic phishing detection:
Suspicious keywords (login, secure, verify, etc.)
Malicious domains
URL length
HTTP vs HTTPS
🧪 Optional VirusTotal API scan
🧩 Easily extendable for more advanced detection models
🧠 Developed At
This project was developed during my internship at Brainwave Matrix as part of a cybersecurity initiative to explore lightweight methods for phishing detection and risk analysis in real-time applications.
